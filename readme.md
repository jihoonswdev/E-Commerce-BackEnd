## Description:
* The E-Commerce Backend allows the creating of a store inventory API through the command-line. The API will store information on products, such as the category they are in, their price, how much stock they have, and their associated store tags.

## User Story:
* As a manager at an internet retail company, I want a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies so that my company can compete with other e-commerce companies.

## Installation:
* To install, you must run MySQL with mysql -u root -p and then input source db/schema.sql. Once you are finished initializing the database, you can enter node seeds in the terminal if you wish to seed the API with example data. If not, you can just run npm start to begin.

## Usage:
* Run the following command at the root of your project and answer the prompted questions:

    * `mysql -u root -p`

    * `Enter PW when promted`

    * `source db/schema.sql`

    * `quit`

    * `npm run seed`

    * `npm start`
